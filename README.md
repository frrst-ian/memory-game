## Features

- Complete the game by achieving a perfect score of 12!

## Technologies Used

- React JS

## Project Challenges

One of the challenges I faced is structuring the components and how I will connect them with the logic of the game. I read a couple of react articles from the official docs , and it helped me to formulate a solution.

## Thoughts and Observations

Share any insights or reflections you have from working on the project. This could include your thoughts on the development process, design decisions etc. Looking back, I haven't really committed on making this project a complete game. I just did this to practice my react skills, specially the concept behind react states and how to fetch API in React JS.

## Future Enhancements

- Add game difficulty options
- Add user login option
- Add leaderboard
